# Agile Software Development Nanodegree udacity
 Project 01: In this project, I stepped in as an Agile consultant to help launch WorldVisitzâ€™s Agile journey. I recommended and defined an Agile delivery solution for WorldVisitz executives to replace their current inefficient traditional product development processes. Based on an assessment of the organization, I prepared a presentation to convince WorldVisitz leaders of the business value and rationale for adopting an Agile framework. Also, I prepared an Agile onboarding presentation to get the team started on their Agile journey.
 
Project 02: In this project,I created a plan to develop a software product for the Centers for Disease Control that will help prevent the spread of a deadly virus.
 I got a specific set of criteria to create a plan for the customer. The plan will include a vision, roadmap, user stories, and a release plan that
 outlines the minimum set of features that are needed to make the product successful and align with business requirements for an MVP.
 
Project 03: In this project, I learned how to plan, organize, monitor, and display project information at a glance. I created a 
Big Visual Information Radiator (BVIR) that can be used by anyone involved in an Agile project to review project goals, work completion status,
 metrics, risks, and target completion date. I learned how to use techniques such as appropriate use of burn-up and burn-down charts,
 prioritization of user stories, identifying risks, and calculating velocity. I learned how to effectively communicate project 
status and appropriate key metrics to a senior management audience within 
a corporation.
